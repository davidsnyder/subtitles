English subtitles for Japanese films

Subtitles are generated using [Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub) which, while free and open source, seems to be spuriously supported today. The latest binary build available on the website is nearly 4 years old. I encountered a breaking UI glitch (the audio waveform zoom toggles were not rendered correctly) using build 3.2.2 in macOS High Sierra and had to build the software myself. The make instructions on the Aegisub github page were generally accurate, and rebuilding Aegisub from the master branch fixed the glitch. 

I've had some trouble with the autosave functionality for the subtitle files, so I recommend you put subtitle files under version control as soon as possible.
